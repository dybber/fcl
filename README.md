Functional Computing Language
=============================
A low-level functional GPU language compiling to OpenCL.

Language.GPUIL
--------------
This module and submodules contain a library for generating OpenCL and
CUDA code. Currently only generating device code.

Language.FCL
----------------------
This aims to be a reimplementation of Obsidian as an external language
(not embedded), using GPUIL for code-generation.

cases
-----
This directory contains different use-cases which we want to
support. Read the README in that directory for more info.

microcl
-------
A small OpenCL wrapper library, making it a lot easier to write
host-code :-)
