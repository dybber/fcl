Functional Computing Language
=============================
A low-level functional GPU language compiling to OpenCL.

Language.GPUIL
--------------
This module and submodules contain a library for generating OpenCL and
CUDA code. Currently only generating device code.

Language.ObsidianLight
----------------------
This aims to be a reimplementation of Obsidian as an external language
(not embedded), using GPUIL for code-generation.

Language.FCL
------------
This was an earlier attempt, trying to replicate some ideas by Dubach
et al., this might be removed at some point.

cases
-----
This directory contains different use-cases which we want to
support. Read the README in that directory for more info.
