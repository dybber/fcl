     *  "Automatic extraction of functional parallelism from ordinary programs"
        (also not available from Chalmers)

   Check also the papers that references this one!
 * Qilin
 * Pencil IR
 * [SPIR](https://www.khronos.org/spir)
 * CUDA PTX. This is what CUDA compiles to, so it might be too
   low-level to be interesting, but maybe there's something to learn from
   it? I have never looked at it in detail.
