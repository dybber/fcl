Copy 1D vs. 2D-grid
------------------
In this experiment we want to measure the difference between copying
a 2D-array using two different approaches to indexing:

 * 1D-indexing, launching a 1D-grid
 * 2D-indexing, launching a 2D-grid

We implement two versions of each case, one using shared memory, and
one not using shared memory.

(Maybe it would also be interesting to do 2D-indexing, but launching a
1D-grid and computing the 2D indices ourselves.)

### Conclusion

The goal was to decide whether we should support 2D/3D grids when
generating OpenCL or not. The results indicate that there is an actual
slow-down when using 2D-grids, so they might just emulate them.

It would be interesting to see differences in generated PTX-code.

### Results
 * Copying 4194304 32-bit integers
 * 1000 executions
 * Workgroup size: 256
 * No work-group virtualization.

Transpose 1D vs. 2D-grid
-----------------------
In this experiment we want to measure the difference between
transposing a 2D-array using two different approaches to indexing:

 * 2D-indexing, launching a 2D-grid
 * 2D-indexing, launching a 1D-grid and computing indices w. div/modulus

The goal is to decide whether we should support 2D/3D grids when
generating OpenCL or not.

### Results

Work-group virtualization
-------------------------
Experiment with the performance penalty of work-group/block
virtualization (strip-mining?) in OpenCL. 

### Conclusions

Work-group virtualization gives some speed-up on our NVIDIA card, but
the slow-down on AMD card shows that it shouldn't be something we do
always.

The FCL-compiler should have a flag for it!

### Results
 * 1000 executions
 * Work-group size: 256
